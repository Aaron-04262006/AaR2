This website is a sleek, dark-themed showcase of the Nissan GT-R sports car, featuring a modern design with a fixed navigation menu that includes Home, About, Gallery, and Contact pages. The homepage prominently displays a 3D model viewer of the GT-R that can be rotated as users scroll, along with large "NISSAN GTR" text and informational sections about the car's specifications and history. The Gallery page offers both video content and multiple high-quality images of various GT-R models displayed in decorative bordered frames, while the About page provides detailed technical information with links to official Nissan resources, and the Contact page features a simple form for visitor inquiries. Throughout the site, a consistent footer displays customer service information, network links, shopping tools, and social media icons, all maintained within the dark blue-gray (#1f242d) and white color scheme using the Poppins font family.
